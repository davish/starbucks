# Our Simulation
Our simulation determines the total profit of a coffee shop with our products (Starbucks drinks) depending on the happiness of its customers and the happiness of its employees. 

Employees are happy when they are payed a certain amount of money and customers are happy when their orders are processed, which is determined based on the the happiness of their employees. 

The simulation returns the average of all profits made from wages for employees between $0 - $99 and a scatter plot of profit is in the notebook. 

After intense data analysis, the most profitable wage for employees is $22 per day.
